  // throw exceptions for routine events, like not finding a barcode on a given row. Instead, we
  // should return error codes back to the callers, and simply delete this class. In the mean time, I
  // have altered this class to be as lightweight as possible, by ignoring the exception string, and
  // by disabling the generation of stack traces, which is especially time consuming. These are just
